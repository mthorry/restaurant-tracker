# Spots App üçΩ
"Spots App" was created with a React frontend and Ruby on Rails backend. Created with @jnmiele. Users can save their favorite bars and restaurants ('spots') from the Yelp API. Users can sort their saved spots by name, price and/or rating.

## Backend
We created the backend of our app using Ruby on Rails. We used the Yelp API and fetch requests are done from the backend.
The models are `User`, `Restaurant` and `Spot`. A `User` can have many `spots`, and many `restaurants` through `spots`. The `Spot` model is the join table between `Restaurant` and `User` and holds a user's comments about the spot.

`User` and `Spot` models required a controller as CRUD actions are available to these models and the `spots_controller` also handled the creation of new `restaurants`. We also have an `auth_controller` for login and a `yelp_controller` for calls to the Yelp API. Active Model Serializers were used to store data.

## Frontend
The frontend was created using React. It has nearly a dozen components with two main containers: `RestaurantsContainer` and `SearchContainer`.

### Spots
**`RestaurantsContainer`** has two children: `RestaurantsList` and `SearchContainer`. We have `SearchContainer` as a child of `RestaurantsContainer` so the `Search` and `Restaurants` containers can communicate and pass props. The chils of `RestaurantsList` is `Spot` which renders the specific restaurant information with the user's comments. `Spots` are displayed in a tiled list with the option to click "My Notes" which toggles the view between user comments and restaurant info.

### Search
**`SearchContainer`** also has three children: `SpotForm`, `SearchResults` and `SearchResult` (which is a child of `SearchResults`). `SearchContainer` is responsible for handling the user's search. Information from the search form is passed to the `yelp_controller` on the backend and results from the API call are handled by `SearchResults` which passes individual restaurant info to `SearchResult` to be displayed. `SpotForm` becomes available after a user selects a restaurant to add from the search results and is responsible for collecting user comments for the restaurant. It then creates a new `spot`.
